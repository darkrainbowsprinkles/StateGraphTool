# State Graph Tool for Unity
## Description:
The State Graph is a powerful and intuitive tool for building gameplay logic visually inside Unity. This tool transforms how behaviors are authored by providing a complete state machine system with a clean node-based interface.

With a focus on modularity and developer experience, this package was built to scale, whether you're prototyping quick ideas or building robust state-driven systems for your game.

## Technical Details:
- **Visual Graph Based Editing**: Create and manage states, transitions, and conditions directly in a user friendly node graph.

- **State Lifecycle**: Define actions for On Enter, On Tick, and On Exit per state, fully customizable via your own logic.

- **Flexible Transition System**: Transitions are powered by custom predicates using conjunctive normal form (AND/OR logic) for unlimited complexity.

- **Extensible**: Easily integrate your own systems by implementing simple action and predicate interfaces. Whether you already have a working control system or you're building one from scratch, adapting it to the state machine requires nothing more than plugging your logic into the provided interfaces, no need to rewrite your existing codebase.

- **Parameter Based Control**: Easily pass parameters from the editor (e.g: movement speeds, animation names, etc.) ideal for rapid iteration without extra scripting.

- **Demo Included**: A fully functional demo scene including a 3rd person combat system is provided to help you get started instantly.
