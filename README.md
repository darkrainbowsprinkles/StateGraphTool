The State Graph is a visual state machine editor for Unity, designed to make creating and managing game logic intuitive and scalable. Built with a clean node-based interface and a modular structure, it lets developers define state-driven behaviors directly within the Unity Editor.

## Technical Details:
- **Visual Graph Based Editing**: Create and manage states, transitions, and conditions directly in a user friendly node graph.

- **State Lifecycle**: Define actions for On Enter, On Tick, and On Exit per state, fully customizable via your own logic.

- **Flexible Transition System**: Transitions are powered by custom predicates using conjunctive normal form (AND/OR logic) for unlimited complexity.

- **Extensible**: Easily integrate your own systems by implementing simple action and predicate interfaces. Whether you already have a working control system or you're building one from scratch, adapting it to the state machine requires nothing more than plugging your logic into the provided interfaces, no need to rewrite your existing codebase.

- **Parameter Based Control**: Easily pass parameters from the editor (e.g: movement speeds, animation names, etc.) ideal for rapid iteration without extra scripting.

- **Demo Included**: A fully functional demo scene including a 3rd person combat system is provided to help you get started instantly.
